# My Scripts
This file will be my scripts of how/if I managed to get any data webscraped from sites such as Stats Wales & ONS (maybe some more).

## 1 - Packages
First step is to get load a few libraries which will be used.
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(csv)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(taRifx)
```

## 2 - Set URL
This section will have code which will set a URL, which will then be scraped together. First is number of gps employed in general practices.
```{r}
# set url
url <- 'https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Health-and-Social-Care/General-Medical-Services/number-of-gps-employed-in-general-practices'
# grab content from url
content <- read_html(url)
```

After setting the url, and grabbing the content from the url, lets go ahead and try to only get the contents which is part of the css field 'table'.
```{r}
get.tables <- content %>% 
  html_element("table") %>% 
  html_table()
```

now to subset the data as it is very messy and only keep the data which is actually important to us.
```{r}
# first only select what columns to keep
slice.one <- get.tables %>% 
  subset(select = 1:7)
# now select what rows to keep
slice.two <- slice.one[c(18:25),]

mydf.staff.gp <- slice.two[1:7]
# kept row names in as can't add them later
# row.names1 = slice.two[,1]
# shorten the names manually.
row.names = c("Wales", "Betsi Cadwaladr Uni",
             "Powys Teaching", "Hywel Dda Uni",
             "Swansea Bay Uni", "Cwm Taf Morgannwg Uni",
             "Aneurin Bevan Uni", "Cardiff and Vale Uni")


# set the names of the table (should be sliced but typing is easier atm.)
col.names <- c("Local Health Board",
              "GP Partner/Provider/SPartner","Salaried",
              "GP Practioner", "GP Registrar",
              "GP Retainer", "GP Locum")

# Apply the names to the table (slice.two)
mydf.staff.gp <- setNames(mydf.staff.gp, col.names)
```

Within the data, there are a few columns which are doubles, example "1,200" - this will need to be converted to a numeric value, which can be done by assigning x value with x as a numeric. (This was done by looking at the value and assigning it as it is typed out instead.)

Also noticed there are 2 symbols within our tibble which isn't required and will slow down the next steps, these symbols are "-" and "*" - lets attempt to replace these with 0's.
```{r}
df.staff.gp <- data.frame(mydf.staff.gp)
# replace the doubles to numeric
df.staff.gp$GP.Partner.Provider.SPartner[1] <- 1467
df.staff.gp$GP.Practioner[1] <- 1963

# replace the "-", "*", "*" with 0's
df.staff.gp$GP.Retainer[3:5] <- c(0,0,0)
print(df.staff.gp)
```

Firstly, it looks like the date from the website has been defaulted to the older date, and I was unable to switch it to work with this code. I will be mindful with this going forward.


![Date Picker - Stats Wales](date-picker.png "Date Picker")

Now that the data has been sliced and carefully selected the parts of the data to keep,
I want to try and get the Total added onto the end of the table which will make analysing it a bit easier.

```{r}
# check column classes
sapply(df.staff.gp, class)
# get list of the character classes
chars <- sapply(df.staff.gp, is.character)
# replace all chars with numeric instead
df.staff.gp[ , chars] <- as.data.frame(apply(df.staff.gp[ , chars], 2, as.numeric))
# sanity check it worked
sapply(df.staff.gp, class)
```
There was a few issues with the data, as it was a mix of characters, strings and doubles (obviously) - So above, I tried to 'sapply' through each column to see which were characters, save these as a list and check the characters against the numeric entries and encode them as numeric. A bit confusing, I know but it worked.

Next lets try to get the Total of staff in GPs across Wales

```{r}
df.staff.gp$Total <- rowSums(df.staff.gp[,c(-1)])

# df.staff.gp$Local.Health.Board <- row.names
# re-assign local health board?

# barplot(df.staff.gp$Total, main = "Total of Staff per GP", xlab = "Local Health Board", ylab = "Total", horiz = F, col = rainbow(8), legend.text = row.names, args.legend = list(x = "topright"))
```


```{r}
plot.one <- 
  ggplot(df.staff.gp, aes(row.names, Total, fill = row.names)) + 
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total, y = (Total/2)), size = 3)

plot.one + 
  labs(title = "Number of GPs employed in general practices", subtitle = "by GP type and local health board (30-September-2020)") +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```

From looking at the plot above it looks like Wales is the Total of all over districts, lets do a sanity check to see if this is correct (if not, look into how these local health boards are set up for better context.)

```{r results='asis'}
gp.districts <- (942+1095+851+765+581+263+694)
print(gp.districts)
print(5160-(gp.districts))
#kable(gp.districts, caption = "Sanity check of GP districts")
# write.csv(x = df.staff.gp, "gp-Totals.csv", row.names = T)
```
It looks like there seems to be 31 entries missing from this dataset, this will have to be kept in mind going forward.

```{r}
df.no.wales <- df.staff.gp[2:7] 
df.no.wales <- df.no.wales[c(-1),]
head(df.no.wales)

# shorten the names manually.
row.names1 = c("Betsi Cadwaladr Uni",
             "Powys Teaching", "Hywel Dda Uni",
             "Swansea Bay Uni", "Cwm Taf Morgannwg Uni",
             "Aneurin Bevan Uni", "Cardiff and Vale Uni")


# set the names of the table (should be sliced but typing is easier atm.)
col.names1 <- c("GP Partner/Provider/SPartner","Salaried",
              "GP Practioner", "GP Registrar",
              "GP Retainer", "GP Locum")

# Apply the names to the table 
df.no.wales <- setNames(df.no.wales, col.names1)
# add Total again
df.no.wales$Total <- rowSums(df.no.wales)


```

Now we have removed 'Wales', lets create another plot but without Wales this time, just the health boards across wales.

```{r}
plot.one.no.wales <- 
  ggplot(df.no.wales, aes(row.names1, Total, fill = row.names1)) + 
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total, y = (Total/2)), 
            size = 3)

plot.one.no.wales + 
  labs(title = "Number of GPs employed in general practices", 
       subtitle = "by GP type and local health board (30-September-2020 - No Wales)") +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```

Now we have the staff employed per HB within Wales, it would be interesting to see how the population is within these HB areas.
I will try to do the same thing as above, but with a different dataset.

```{r}
# set new url
url.pop <- "https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Population-and-Migration/Population/Estimates/Local-Health-Boards/populationestimates-by-welshhealthboard-year"
# grab content from url
content.pop <- read_html(url.pop)
# grab the tables from the page
get.tables.pop <- content.pop %>% 
  html_element("table") %>% 
  html_table()
```

This table seems to be much bigger than the first one, so some of the script might need tweaking.

```{r}
# first only select what columns to keep
slice.pop1 <- get.tables.pop %>% 
  subset(select = 2:14)
# now select what rows to keep
slice.pop2 <- slice.pop1[c(25:32),]
# drop the area code
slice.pop3 <- slice.pop2[c(-2)]

# get the years
slice.pop.years <- get.tables.pop[15:25]
slice.pop.years <- slice.pop.years[c(18),]

# get the areas
slice.pop.areas <- slice.pop3[1]

# Get all data without areas
df.pop <- slice.pop3[-1]
# set the column names (years)
df.pop <- setNames(df.pop, slice.pop.years)

```

This has sliced the data correctly, but now we need to convert it from char/list to numeric again.

```{r}
# de-string the numbers ( ## this was an issue >.< ## )
df.pop <- lapply(df.pop, destring)
# check the class again
class(df.pop)
# the class is a list, which we want as a dataframe again as numeric.
df.pop <- data.frame(matrix(unlist(df.pop),ncol=11, nrow=8),stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
# finally converted from character/list to df.
class(df.pop)
```
Here we have managed to convert the data which was a lot harder this time with a lot of types (doubles, characters and lists) - this was made easier with a package discovered on 05/07/2021 called 'taRifx' and using 'destring'.

Now that the data has been stripped and converted, we need to add the column names and row names again, to create a plots like above with Wales and without Wales.

```{r}
# get the years, but only keep the years and remove 'Mid-year'
# and trim the white space, just to make sure.
slice.pop.years <-  slice.pop.years %>% str_replace_all('Mid-year', '') %>% trimws()
# add the col names with setNames
df.pop <- setNames(df.pop, slice.pop.years)
# column bind the Health Board Areas with df.pop
df.pop <- cbind(slice.pop.areas, df.pop)
# sanity check
df.pop
df.pop <- rename(df.pop, "Health Board" = "X2")
# add Total again
df.pop$Total <- rowSums(df.pop[-1])
```

Now to try and plot the Total population per health board.

```{r}
# update the col names pop
col.names.pop <- c("Health Board", slice.pop.years)

plot.two <- 
  ggplot(df.pop, aes(`Health Board`, Total, fill = `Health Board`)) + 
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total, y = (Total/2)), size = 3)

plot.two + 
  labs(title = "Population estimates", subtitle = "by local health boards and year (2009:2019)") +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())

```

Now to try it without Wales again, which is throwing off the plot.

```{r}
# save df.pop without wales
df.pop.no.wales <- df.pop[-1,]
#write.csv(df.pop.no.wales, 'pop-estimates.csv')

plot.two.no.wales <- 
  ggplot(df.pop[-1,], aes(`Health Board`, Total, fill = `Health Board`)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = Total, y = (Total/2)), size = 3)

plot.two.no.wales + 
  labs(title = "Population estimates", subtitle = "by local health boards and year (2009 - 2019)") +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())

```

Now lets try to do a time series ( big ask :P ) with the dataset, the data might need to be manipulated even more, but lets see.
```{r}
# remove health board
tempD <- df.pop[-1]
# remove Wales
tempD <- tempD[-1,]
# remove Total
tempD <- tempD[1:11]
```   

```{r}
# create a time series object as tempD
tempD %>% ts(start = 2009, frequency = 1) -> tempTS
flipD <- t(tempD) 
flipNames <- t(slice.pop.areas) 
flipNames <- flipNames[-1]
flipD <- colnames(flipNames)

# create a time vector
time <- 1:length(flipD)
# check the summary
summary(flipD)

#plot.ts(flipD)
```

## X - Exploring just Aneurin Bevan
This section will be used to try and do something with just the area of Aniren Bevan. Hopefully looking at the GPs vs Population estimates in one table and maybe doing something with the time series data.


```{r}
df.bevan1 <- rbind(df.pop.no.wales[6,])
df.bevan2 <- df.no.wales[6,]
print(paste(round(df.bevan1$Total/df.bevan2$Total), "people need to be seen by 1 doctor.")) 
```
## Y - Exploring Population Health per Health Board
Here I want to try and get some data around the general health and illness by local authority and health board, although this section will mainly look at the health via health board. 

```{r}
# set population per health board url
healthPop <- "https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/National-Survey-for-Wales/Population-Health/Adult-general-health-and-illness/genhealthillness-by-localauthorityhealthboard"
# grab content from url
content.healthPop <- read_html(healthPop)
# grab the tables from the page
get.tables.healthPop <- healthPop %>% 
  html_element("table") %>% 
  html_table()

```


```{r}
# Remove everything which we no longer need to free up some memory/RAM.
# remove(list=c('content', 'get.tables', 'mydf.staff.gp', 'row.names1', 'slice.one', 'slice.two', 'chars', 'col.names', 'row.names', 'url'))
```
